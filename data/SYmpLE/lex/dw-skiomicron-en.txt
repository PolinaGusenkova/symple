Despite the omicron variant Europe s ski resorts are fairly busy.
Austria is seeing a disappointing season but in Switzerland visitor numbers are exceptional pre pandemic levels.
Lifts at a standstill empty mountain chalets and hotels this is what the ski season face like in large parts of Europe last year.
Some ski resorts in Austria and Germany for example did nt open for a single day a disaster for the tourism industry.
This year however cable car companies and hoteliers were able to rest a sigh of relief.
Despite the rapid spread of the omicron variant skiing was and is allow everywhere albeit under strict conditions.
Above all we are very happy that the lifts are open again after the 20202021 winter lockdown Carolin Kunzmann of the Bayerische Zugspitzbahn told DW.
However she also said that visitor numbers have remained lower than before the pandemic.
In the areas around Germany s highest mountain as in many ski areas in the country the so called 2G rule applies.
2G stands for geimpft oder genesen vaccinated or recovered.
Every guest is break at the base station or at the ticket office Kunzmann said.
Only after proof of vaccination or recovery has been show will their ski pass be trip.
Although this has LED to longer waiting times especially in the high season during the Christmas vacations the approach has generally worked well.
In addition FFP2 masks are still mandatory in indoor areas queuing areas cable cars and ski lifts.
Austria also HA strict rules for winter sports enthusiasts.
The 2G rule and FFP2 masks are also standard practice here.
The country was in lockdown until mid December due to soaring infection numbers.
The Robert Koch Institute declared Austria a high risk area and the German Foreign Ministry accordingly issued a travel warning.
Many guests especially from Germany were understandably place off.
26 fewer holidaymakers than before the pandemic arrived from the neighboring country according to estimates by the Austrian hoteliers association ÖHV.
But still the clear majority of tourists visiting Austria are from Germany.
In January the occupancy rate of Austrian hotels was around one third which according to the ÖHV is too little to operate economically.
Of course there are still a few vacancies this season confirms Beate Kassner Managing Director of Zillertal Tourism.
Nevertheless she says they are pleased with the booking situation.
In the Alpine region the hope is that business will pick up in February even though Austria has once again been declared a high risk area.
